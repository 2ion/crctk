# crctk: A Guide by Example

This guide explains the features crctk has using practical examples and
more verbose language than what would be suitable for a man page.

## This Tool's Purpose

CRCs -- cyclic redundancy checks -- are a type of error detection codes;
and in particular the CRC32 code is quite short with a length of 8 bytes
or ASCII characters. It is thus suited for being included into the file
name proper instead of an checksum catalouge (a function crctk also
supports).
