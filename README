Upstream: https://github.com/2ion/crctk
Usage: crctk [-vVcCoptsreh] <file>|<file-list>
Options:
 -v Compute CRC32 and compare with the hexstring
    in the supplied filename.
    Return values: EXIT_SUCCESS: match
                   EXIT_FAILURE: no match
                   0xA: invalid argument
                   0xB: regex compilation error
                   0xC: unknown error
 -V FILE. Read checksums and filenames from a FILE
    created by the -C option and check if the files
    have the listed checksums.
 -c Compute the CRC32 of the given file, print and exit.
 -C for multiple input files, create a checksum listing
    for use with the -V option.
 -p FILE. Print the contents of a file created by the -C
    options to stdout.
 -t Tag file with a CRC32 hexstring. Aborts if
    the filename does already contain a tag.
 -s Supplements -t: strip eventually existing tag
    and compute a new CRC32 hexstring.
    Return values: EXIT_SUCCESS: success
                   EXIT_FAILURE: generic failure
                   Rest as above.
 -r If the file is tagged, remove the tag.
 -e EXPR. Changes the regular expression used to
    match tags when doing -s|-r to EXPR. Default:
    [[:punct:]]\?[[:xdigit:]]\{8\}[[:punct:]]\?
 -h Print this message and exit successfully.
